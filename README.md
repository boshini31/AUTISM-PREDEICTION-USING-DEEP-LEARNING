# AUTISM-PREDEICTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
This project uses deep learning models to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from behavioral, medical, and demographic data, aiming to assist in early diagnosis with high accuracy.
 The system involves preprocessing the dataset, selecting important features, and training a deep neural network model, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to classify individuals as either having ASD or not.

The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, along with cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness. Additionally, the model provides interpretability by identifying which features play the most significant role in diagnosing ASD.

Built using TensorFlow, Keras, and Python, this deep learning-based approach aims to assist healthcare professionals in early ASD detection, improving diagnostic accuracy and facilitating timely intervention. The project also offers insights into the practical application of deep learning in healthcare.
